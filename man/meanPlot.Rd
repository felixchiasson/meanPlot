\usage{
meanPlot(data, bsfactor = NULL, wsfactor = NULL, wslevels = NULL,
  measure, statistic = "mean", errorbar = "SE", popsize = Inf,
  purpose = "single", decorrelation = "none", sep = "_")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame}

\item{bsfactor}{The name of your between-subject factor(s)}

\item{wsfactor}{The name of your within-subject factor(s)}

\item{wslevels}{The number of levels in your within-subject factor (for repeated measures only)}

\item{measure}{Your dependent variable}

\item{errorbar}{The content of your error bar. Can either be "CI" or "SE". Defaults to "SE"}

\item{popsize}{Size of the population under study if known. Defaults to Inf}

\item{purpose}{The purpose of the comparisons. Defaults to "single"}

\item{decorrelation}{For repeated measure designs only. Chooses the decorrelation method ("CM" or "LM"). Defaults to "none".}

\item{sep}{The separator used to separate dependent variables from within-subject factors in a wide data frame. Defaults to "_"}
