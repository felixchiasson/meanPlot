\usage{
meanPlot(data = NULL, betweenVar = NULL, withinVar = NULL,
  withinLevels = NULL, measure, summaryStatistic = "mean",
  errorBarContent = "SE", popSize = Inf, purpose = "single",
  decorrelation = "none", sep = "_")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame}

\item{betweenVar}{The name of your between-subject factor(s)}

\item{withinVar}{The name of your within-subject factor(s)}

\item{withinLevels}{The number of levels in your within-subject factor (for repeated measures only)}

\item{measure}{Your dependent variable}

\item{errorBarContent}{The content of your error bar. Can either be "CI" or "SE". Defaults to "SE"}

\item{popSize}{Size of the population under study if known. Defaults to Inf}

\item{purpose}{The purpose of the comparisons. Defaults to "single"}

\item{decorrelation}{For repeated measure designs only. Chooses the decorrelation method ("CM" or "LM"). Defaults to "none".}

\item{sep}{The separator used to separate dependent variables from within-subject factors in a wide data frame. Defaults to "_"}
